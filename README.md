LUTCalc
=======

A Web App for generating 1D and 3D Lookup Tables (LUTs) for video cameras that shoot log gammas, principally the Sony CineAlta line.

LUTCalc generates 1D and 3D .cube format LUTs suitable for use in DaVinci Resolve, Adobe Speedgrade and as user 3D LUTs in Sony's log-recording video cameras. These include the PMW-F5, PMW-F55 and PXW-FS7..

How To Start
------------
Mac OSX Safari: For Mac OSX users, the sister [LUTCalc For Mac](https://github.com/cameramanben/LUTCalc-For-Mac) project provides a native app version using a sandbox-friendly Objective-C Webkit wrapper around the LUTCalc Javascript.
Chrome (Windows, Mac or Linux): LUTCalc currently needs to be run as an app extension. Either click Window->Extensions in the menu bar or type chrome://extensions in the address bar. Check 'developer mode' in the top right, then click 'Load unpacked extension' and find the main LUTCalc directory and click select. LUTCalc should then show up on the list of installed extensions. You can now uncheck developer mode and start LUTCalc either by clicking 'Launch' or from the Chrome App Launcher.
Firefox: I have been developing using Firefox, so opening index.html in the main directory should work.
Internet Explorer: currently looking in to making this work.

Gamma / Gamut Information

The sources of information used are white papers and standards documents, analysis and comparison of test images and LUT calculations using known reference LUTs.

LUTCalc File List
=================

Main Files
----------
* index.html (window.html) - HTML5 base of LUTCalc. Launch to start.
* lutcalc.js - main Javascript file. Initialises all the UI and calculation objects and sets up the event handlers.

UI Files
--------
* lutcamerabox.js - builds the UI object where camera and ISO are chosen.
* lutgammabox.js - builds the UI object for transfer curve (gamma) and  colour space (gamut) selection.
* luttweaksbox.js - builds the UI object for customising the transfer (gamma) curves and colour spaces / gamuts.
* lutanalyst.js - extension to luttweaksbox which reads and then analyses LUTs into transfer function and colour space components so that they can be adapted for use with other input colour spaces and further tweaked as with the built-in options.
* lutlutbox.js - builds the UI object containing options concerning the LUT format.
* lutgeneratebox.js - builds the 'Generate' button that triggers the LUT generation, plus the generation logic itself.
* lutpreview.js - builds the UI object which previews LUTs on test images.
* lutinfobox.js - builds the UI object which shows instructions, plots of the input and output gammas against stop and IRE and data values for correct exposure with the chosen output gamma.
